## High-Performance Native Rust Toolchain

The repository embeds a compiled, high-performance native Rust toolchain (`Cargo.toml` workspace) delivering sub-second execution across all core digital engineering compiler gates, with transparent Python wrapper fallbacks:

| Crate | Binary / Target | Role & Architectural Responsibilities |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `crates/ingest-sysml` | `./target/release/ingest-sysml` | **Ground 0.0 Ingestion Engine**: High-throughput parsing and normalization of unstructured OEM documentation, PDF manuals, BOM markdown tables, and Level 1C ICD registers into canonical SysML v2 textual models. |
| `crates/compile-sysml` | `./target/release/compile-sysml` | **SysML v2 / KerML Compiler & STPA Transpiler**: Deterministic SysML v2 compilation, semantic validation, bidirectional AST synchronization (`--reverse-sync`, `--forward-sync`), and formal STPA / FMECA constraint transpilation. |
| `crates/assemble-conops` | `./target/release/assemble-conops` | **ConOps & Mission Intent Assembly Engine**: High-throughput deterministic assembly of modular ConOps and Mission Intent units into canonical master specifications with parameter binding and TOC generation. |
| `crates/verify-baseline` | `./target/release/verify-baseline` | **Checks 10-31 Quality Gate Verifier**: Ultra-fast baseline conformance, KaTeX math parsing, Mermaid diagram validation, and semantic diagram-to-AST parity auditor. |
| `crates/deap-core` | `libdeap_core.rlib` | **Shared Core Foundation**: Shared AST representations, Markdown & KaTeX lexer/scanner, diagnostic reporting, defect dossier synthesis, and repository rule engines. |

### Toolchain Build & Verification Commands

cargo test

# Build optimized release binaries
cargo build --release
```

---

## 3. Project Lifecycle & Tooling Maintenance

### 3.1 Downstream Baseline Verification & Ingestion Workflows (Quick Start)

To verify that all repository issue tracker labels, baseline contracts, and safety fixtures pass downstream conformance gates, run:

```bash
# Run baseline conformance verification (native Rust binary with Python fallback)
./target/release/verify-baseline . --no-domain
# (or python3 scripts/verify_downstream_baseline.py --no-domain)
```

For customer projects starting with unstructured OEM technical documentation, PDF flight manuals, or Bill of Materials (BOM) specifications, execute Level 0 OEM Ground Truth Ingestion (Step 0.0):

```bash
# Run Level 0 OEM Ground Truth ingestion (native Rust binary with Python fallback)
./target/release/ingest-sysml --schema "schema/extracted/" --format markdown --out "schema/model.sysml"
# (or python3 skills/spec-orchestrator/scripts/sysmlv2_ingest.py --schema "schema/extracted/" --format markdown --out "schema/model.sysml")

# Verify model compilation gate (native Rust binary with Python fallback)
./target/release/compile-sysml --compile
# (or python3 scripts/compile_sysml.py --compile)
```

### 3.2 In-Place Pipeline Tooling Update

To update local pipeline tooling, governance rules, and verification scripts in-place at any time without re-onboarding:

```bash
# Update local pipeline tooling in-place
bash scripts/install_pipeline.sh .
```

### 3.3 Mandatory Agent Initialization Sequence (Universal Initialization Sequence)

Immediately following installation, any AI agent (Antigravity, Claude Code, Cursor) initializing in this repository MUST execute the following sequence before accepting user directives or executing task implementations:

0. **Detect Repository Role & Scope (Direct-Path Read)**: Inspect whether `.pipeline/upstream/` exists on disk via direct-path read (`list_dir` or `view_file`). Do not rely on glob or search tools that ignore hidden dot-directories.
   - If absent -> **Downstream Customer Project Mode**: Authorized for customer feature implementation and domain codebase delivery.
1. **Read Governance Constitution**: Execute `view_file` on `.pipeline/constitution.md` to ingest the platform-independent functional governance layer and zero-mocking persistence mandates.
2. **Load Project Skills**: Execute `view_file` on `skills/feature-driven-implementation/SKILL.md` (and any active skills under `skills/` or `.agents/skills/`) to initialize feature-driven implementation protocols and review gates.
3. **Load Governance Rules**: Execute `view_file` on `.pipeline/ACTIVE_RULES_BUNDLE.md` to ingest the complete, consolidated suite of active governance rules in a single read (covering dual-track MBD, SysML SSOT completeness, role boundary locks, and TDD mandates).
4. **Load Platform Profile**: Read the target platform execution profile (`.pipeline/profiles/flutter.md`, `.pipeline/profiles/react.md`, `.pipeline/profiles/ros2_cpp.md`, or `.pipeline/profiles/px4_module.md`) to establish platform-specific build, test, and lifecycle constraints.
5. **Bootstrap Tracker Labels & Verify Baseline**: Verify that repository issue tracker labels and baseline conformance pass by running `./target/release/verify-baseline . --no-domain` (or `python3 scripts/verify_downstream_baseline.py --no-domain`).

### 4.2 Pipeline 0 Execution Prompts

Execute the following prompts in sequence using context-isolated subagents to transform unstructured intent, operational scenarios, and interface schemas into formal CONOPS, STPA hazard matrices, and SysML v2 AST models:

#### 4.2.0 Worker 00: OEM Prose / BOM Ingestion & Model Synthesis Prompt (Step 0.0)

**Step 0.0 Entrypoint for Unstructured / Prose Customer Documentation:**
For customer projects starting with unstructured OEM prose manuals, PDF documentation, markdown tables, or Bill of Materials (BOM) specifications, Worker 00 provides the sanctioned, deterministic entrypoint. Extracting OEM Bill of Materials (BOM) and physical parameters into `schema/extracted/` and synthesizing canonical SysML v2 textual models in `schema/model.sysml` (or `.pipeline/schema.sysml`) is fully authorized under Check 23 (Factual Grounding & Numeric Provenance Gate) and serves as the mandatory precursor to executing the Step 0 compilation gate (`./target/release/compile-sysml --compile` or `python3 scripts/compile_sysml.py --compile`).

```text
Execute `view_file` on `skills/spec-orchestrator/SKILL.md` as your very first step before taking any action.

Repository Classification: UPSTREAM_SPEC_CORE_COMPILER (or DOWNSTREAM_CUSTOMER_PROJECT depending on execution context)

Role: Worker 00 -- OEM Prose / BOM Ingestion & Model Synthesizer (Step 0.0)

Primary Commercial Toolchain Integration Context:
This project explicitly declares MATLAB / Simulink / Stateflow / Embedded Coder as the Primary Tier-1 Commercial Toolchain Integration Context (Model-Based Design, Control Law Synthesis, DO-178C C/SPARK Ada code generation).

Directive:
Execute Level 0 OEM Ground Truth Ingestion and initial SysML v2 textual model synthesis for customer projects starting from unstructured OEM prose manuals, PDF documentation, markdown tables, or Bill of Materials (BOM) specifications:

1. Unstructured & Semi-Structured Ingestion Scope:
   - Ingest raw OEM technical documentation, flight/operating manuals, ICD tables, and BOM markdown tables located in `schema/` and `schema/extracted/`.
   - Authorized Under Check 23: Extract physical parameters, component hierarchies, mass/power budgets, port/pin interfaces, and operational envelopes into machine-readable Markdown tables in `schema/extracted/` (e.g., `schema/extracted/oem_bom.md`, `schema/extracted/interface_table.md`, `schema/extracted/parametric_limits.md`).

2. Canonical SysML v2 Model Synthesis:
   - Execute the Level 0 ingestion translator:
     ./target/release/ingest-sysml --schema "schema/extracted/" --format markdown --out "schema/model.sysml" (or python3 skills/spec-orchestrator/scripts/sysmlv2_ingest.py --schema "schema/extracted/" --format markdown --out "schema/model.sysml")
   - Alternatively, synthesize a formal SysML v2 textual model `schema/model.sysml` directly, defining:
     * Root `package` matching the target cyber-physical system.
     * All component definitions as canonical `part def` elements with typed attributes (mass, power, dimensions, channel count, part numbers).
     * Directional communication and electrical interface boundaries as `port def` elements (`in`, `out`, `inout`).
     * Physical, environmental, and operational constraints as `constraint def` / `assert constraint` blocks.
     * State machine structures and operational lifecycle phases as `state def` elements.

3. Compilation Gate Precursor Verification:
   - Verify that the generated `schema/model.sysml` passes the Step 0 SysML Compilation Gate:
     ./target/release/compile-sysml --compile (or python3 scripts/compile_sysml.py --compile)
   - Ensure `.pipeline/schema.sysml` and `.pipeline/schema-digest.json` are successfully generated without compilation errors.
   - Verify Check 23 compliance (Factual Grounding & Numeric Provenance Gate): all physical parameters and component counts in `schema/model.sysml` strictly match the Level 0 OEM ground truth in `schema/extracted/`.

Defect Filing Directive:
If any compiler fault, schema inconsistency, or invariant violation is discovered, you are strictly forbidden from filing raw issues directly. You MUST dispatch a fresh context-isolated subagent with `skills/adversarial-code-auditor/SKILL.md` to perform the 5-pillar audit, generate the verified 7-section defect dossier, and submit it via `python3 scripts/file_defect.py`. Issue auto-closing keywords or issue close commands are strictly forbidden.

4. Assembly & Verification Gates:
   - Execute deterministic assembly: `./target/release/assemble-conops --input-dir docs/conops/units/ --output-dir docs/conops/ --verify (or python3 scripts/assemble_conops.py --input-dir docs/conops/units/ --output-dir docs/conops/ --verify)`.
   - Compile master specification documents: `./target/release/assemble-conops --input-dir docs/conops/units/ --output-dir docs/conops/ (or python3 scripts/assemble_conops.py --input-dir docs/conops/units/ --output-dir docs/conops/)`.
   - Gate 26 Validation: Execute `python3 -m unittest tests.test_conops_and_mission_intent_validators`.

Defect Filing Directive:
If any compiler fault, schema inconsistency, or invariant violation is discovered, you are strictly forbidden from filing raw issues directly.

#### 4.5.1 Worker 2A.1 / Synthesis Driver: Flutter Feature Implementation Prompt

```text
Execute `view_file` on `skills/feature-driven-implementation/SKILL.md` as your very first step before taking any action.

Repository Classification: DOWNSTREAM_CUSTOMER_PROJECT

Role: Worker 2A.1 -- Flutter Feature-Driven Implementation Specialist

Primary Commercial Toolchain Integration Context:
This project explicitly declares MATLAB / Simulink / Stateflow / Embedded Coder as the Primary Tier-1 Commercial Toolchain Integration Context (Model-Based Design, Control Law Synthesis, DO-178C C/SPARK Ada code generation).

Target Directory & Confinement Invariant:
All source code, assets, configurations, and tests MUST reside exclusively under `app_flutter/`. Writing source code or configuration files at repository root is strictly prohibited.

Architecture Pattern:
MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) layered architecture. Views are stateless widgets consuming ViewModels via dependency injection. ViewModels manage domain state and event streams. Domain entities are decoupled from presentation. All persistence transactions must interact exclusively with abstract repositories resolved dynamically at bootstrap.

The 15 Mandatory Domain Engineering Standards:
1. Result<T> Over Exceptions: All fallible domain operations and repository methods MUST return explicit Result<T> signatures (Success<T> or Failure<T>) rather than throwing untyped runtime exceptions.
2. Sealed Class Hierarchies: Domain states, algebraic data types, events, and error hierarchies MUST use sealed class hierarchies (`sealed class`) to enforce exhaustive pattern matching.
3. Named Constructors with Validation: Complex domain entities MUST declare private or named constructors performing assertion and validation logic to guarantee invalid objects cannot be instantiated.
4. Typed Errors per Domain: Every domain module MUST define explicit, strongly-typed error classes extending a sealed domain error base (`DomainError`) rather than returning raw error strings or untyped exceptions.
5. @immutable Annotation Mandatory: Every domain class, entity, value object, event, and state container MUST be annotated with `@immutable` to enforce compile-time immutability.
6. Interface Segregation: Domain interfaces and repository contracts MUST be narrow, lean, and highly cohesive so clients do not depend on unused methods.
7. Zero dynamic: The use of `dynamic` or untyped `Object?` in domain signatures, interfaces, properties, or variables is strictly prohibited. All data flows must be strongly typed.
8. BDD Test Naming: Unit and integration test names for domain logic MUST use explicit BDD behavior-driven naming patterns (`given_when_then` or `should [behavior] when [condition]`).
9. UML Traceability Tags Mandatory: Every public domain class, interface, mixin, extension, or typedef header MUST include a DartDoc traceability tag (`/// Realises: [SpecName/ClassName]`) referencing its underlying specification or UML classifier.
10. Public Member Docstrings Mandatory: Full DartDoc comments (`///`) are mandatory for every public class, interface, method, function, constructor, getter, and property in the domain layer.
11. const Constructors: Immutable domain classes and value objects with final fields MUST declare const constructors to support compile-time constant canonicalization.
12. Value Equality: All domain value objects and entities MUST override `operator ==` and `hashCode` (or extend Equatable) to guarantee value-based equality.
13. Typedefs for Callbacks: Callback functions, listener signatures, and event handlers MUST be declared as explicit typedef aliases rather than raw inline function types.
14. Private Constructors with Public Factories: Domain entities requiring construction validation MUST restrict direct instantiation via private constructors (`._()`) and expose public factory constructors.
15. Separation of Serialization: Domain models MUST remain completely decoupled from JSON, database, or network serialization logic (`fromJson`/`toJson`). Serialization logic MUST reside strictly in separate DTOs or data layer adapters.

Execution Standards & Governance Mandates:
- Adopt the feature-driven-implementation skill by reading `.pipeline/constitution.md`, `.pipeline/ACTIVE_RULES_BUNDLE.md`, and `.pipeline/profiles/flutter.md`.
- Section 1.9 Zero-Mocking Live Persistence Mandate: All client-side application targets MUST connect to a live persistent database, emulator, or local register map at runtime; in-memory mocks are strictly prohibited.
- 3-Layer Definition of Done (DoD):
  1. Layer 1: Domain State & Signal Model -- Strongly-typed domain models, value objects, and repository interfaces.
  2. Layer 2: Logic & Safety State Management -- ViewModels, statecharts, reactive bindings, and event streams.
  3. Layer 3: Display & Actuator Interface Binding -- High-density Flutter widgets, container queries, and BDD User Story Widget tests.
- TDD RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle: Write failing test first, verify failure, write minimal passing code, verify pass, refactor.
