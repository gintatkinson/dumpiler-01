Execute the total metadata integrity and taxonomy standardization plan in gintatkinson/dumpiler-01:

### 1. Unified Metadata Contract (Eliminate YAML Frontmatter)
In `crates/compile-sysml/src/sync/forward.rs`:
- Remove raw YAML frontmatter (--- ... ---) from all specification generation templates (Epics, Features, User Stories, Use Cases).
- Emit the native CommonMark 2-column table directly at lines 1-10 with exact header:
  | Attribute | Specification Detail |
  | :--- | :--- |
- Include all mandatory attributes per rules/specification-metadata-integrity.md:
  - Epics: Issue ID, Title, Type, Package, Subsystem, Generation Mode, Specification Source (e.g. [schema/model.sysml](../../schema/model.sysml)).
  - Features: Issue ID, Title, Type, Parent Epic link, Interface Type, Schema Containers, Generation Mode, Specification Source.
  - User Stories: Issue ID, Title, Type, Parent Epic link, SysML Interaction, SysML Test Case, Generation Mode, Specification Source.
  - Use Cases: Issue ID, Title, Type, Primary Actor, Scope, Level, Generation Mode, Specification Source.
In `.pipeline/constitution.md`:
- Update line 94 to mandate unique issue_id in the CommonMark metadata table instead of YAML frontmatter.
In `crates/verify-baseline/src/spec_audit/`:
- Ensure metadata validator verifies CommonMark table at lines 1-10 and flags raw YAML frontmatter in specs as a finding.

### 2. Taxonomy Standardization (Purge "Worker" & Fractional Phases)
- In `skills/spec-orchestrator/SKILL.md`: Purge all occurrences of "Worker" and fractional phases (Phase 0.5, Phase 0.75). Standardize on Phase (Macro Milestone), Step (Procedural Step), and Subagent Role.
- In `skills/feature-driven-implementation/SKILL.md`: Standardize all agent references to context-isolated Subagents with explicit Roles.
- In `.pipeline/constitution.md`: Purge legacy references to "workers".
- Recompile `.pipeline/ACTIVE_RULES_BUNDLE.md`.

### 3. Closed-Loop Toolchain Execution & Remote Sync
- Run `cargo build --release --workspace`.
- Run `./target/release/compile-sysml --forward-sync --force` to regenerate all 94 specification files in `docs/` with the compliant CommonMark table at lines 1-10.
- Run `./target/release/verify-baseline . --spec-only` (assert 0 findings).
- Run `./target/release/verify-baseline . --no-domain` (assert all 31 checks pass).
- Commit with neutral citation: `feat(spec-core): enforce native metadata tables and clean taxonomy (refs #115)`.
- Push to `origin/main` and verify `git diff origin/main` is empty.

Invariants:
- Zero Em Dash Invariant: Unicode em dashes (\u2014) are strictly forbidden. Use ASCII -- exclusively.
- Commit Message Non-Closure Invariant: Auto-closing keywords are forbidden. Use neutral citations: (refs #115).

Full multi-stage team: Complete the adversarial audit, publish the GitHub defect issue, and implement the Rust consolidation fix.

Execute an adversarial code audit on brittle shell scripts (>50 lines: `skills/spec-orchestrator/scripts/create_issue.sh`, `scripts/file_defect.sh`, `scripts/verify_commit_messages.sh`, `scripts/verify_subagent_output.sh`), publish a canonical 7-section defect dossier to GitHub issues, and eliminate shell script sprawl by consolidating linters, checkers, and tracker operations into the native Rust toolchain (`crates/verify-baseline` and `crates/reconcile-backlog`).

Working directory: /Users/perkunas/jail/dumpiler-01
Integrity mode: development

## Problem & Context (Verbatim User Directive)

"ALL scripts are a totaly eveolutionary impulsive hack and patch solution in this project. We said rust only... afte line 50 a script is no longer a simple operational execution shell. Dispatch this whole problem to the adverserial agent for detailed analysis and issue posting then on to debug protocol for fixing."

Audit targets:
- `skills/spec-orchestrator/scripts/create_issue.sh` (258 lines)
- `scripts/file_defect.sh` (147 lines)
- `scripts/verify_commit_messages.sh` (132 lines)
- `scripts/verify_subagent_output.sh` (91 lines)
- `.pipeline/scripts/verify_secret_leak.sh` (51 lines)

## Requirements

### R1. Adversarial 4-Pillar Code Audit & 5 Whys Analysis
- Audit target scripts against the 4 correctness risk pillars:
  - Resource Lifecycle (temporary files, traps, process forks)
  - Test Integrity / Semantic Traceability (lack of static typing, absence of compile-time verification)
  - Platform Independence / Fragility (macOS vs GNU sed/awk/grep differences, TSV column scraping, unescaped string parsing)
- Execute a 5 Whys Root Cause Analysis investigating why the Zero-Python purge left un-typed Bash programs in an alleged "Rust Only" workspace.
- Construct a Mermaid diagram in Section 4 contrasting the brittle shell pipeline (awk TSV scraping, sed regex) with the native Rust AST & serde_json architecture already present in `crates/reconcile-backlog` and `crates/verify-baseline`.
- Format the audit strictly according to the canonical 7-section defect dossier schema required by `skills/adversarial-code-auditor/SKILL.md`:
  - `## 1. Context and References`
  - `## 2. Root Cause Analysis (5 Whys)`
  - `## 3. Correctness Analysis`
  - `## 4. UML Diagrams`
  - `## 5. Affected Callers / Downstream Impact`
  - `## 6. Proposed Correction`
  - `## 7. Relationship to Existing Issues`
  - `## Audit Source`
- Save the report to `docs/reports/defects/SHELL_SCRIPTS_SPRAWL_AUDIT.md`.

### R2. Defect Publication & Issue Tracking
- Publish the defect dossier as an issue on GitHub using `gh issue create` with label `bug` and title:
  `[AUDIT] Architecture: Eliminate brittle shell scripts (>50 lines) and consolidate into native Rust toolchain`
- Capture and log the live issue number and URL.

### R3. Native Rust Toolchain Consolidation
- Extend `crates/verify-baseline` with native subcommands:
  - `check-commit-msg`: Port regex commit linter and non-closure invariant check.
  - Output integrity checks: Port fence balancing and `{{REQUIRED_*}}` token validation.
  - Defect dossier validation: Port 7-section defect schema validation.
- Extend `crates/reconcile-backlog` with `create-issue` CLI subcommand:
  - Utilize `TrackerClient` trait and `serde_json` to handle duplicate search, title indexing, label creation, and issue creation.
- Reduce or eliminate the audited shell scripts:
  - Replace or reduce `create_issue.sh`, `file_defect.sh`, `verify_commit_messages.sh`, and `verify_subagent_output.sh` to lightweight wrappers <= 15-50 lines delegating directly to compiled release binaries (`./target/release/verify-baseline`, `./target/release/reconcile-backlog`).
- Fix existing compile error in `crates/compile-sysml/src/sync/forward.rs:808` (matching format arguments count) so `cargo check --workspace` compiles cleanly.

### R4. Verification & Baseline Conformance
- Build and verify compiler workspace via `cargo check --workspace` and `cargo build --release --workspace`.
- Run line count audit across all shell scripts in the repository (`find . -name "*.sh" -not -path "*/target/*" -not -path "*/.git/*" | xargs wc -l`) asserting all operational scripts are <= 50 lines.
- Run `./target/release/verify-baseline . --no-domain` and verify all 31 checks pass with exit code 0.
- Update the filed GitHub defect issue with verification evidence and transition label to `status:fixed-resolved`.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Audit & Publication Gate
- [ ] 7-section defect dossier generated at `docs/reports/defects/SHELL_SCRIPTS_SPRAWL_AUDIT.md` adhering to `skills/adversarial-code-auditor/SKILL.md`.
- [ ] Defect issue published on GitHub via `gh issue create` with title, body, and label `bug`; issue URL reported.

### Implementation & Toolchain Integrity

- [ ] Target shell scripts are <= 50 lines (or replaced by binary invocations).
- [ ] `cargo check --workspace` and `cargo build --release --workspace` pass with exit code 0.
- [ ] `./target/release/verify-baseline . --no-domain` passes all checks with exit code 0.

CRITICAL ARCHITECTURE INVARIANT REINFORCEMENT:
Strictly zero regex (Anti-Regex Invariant / Failure Mode 10).
Do NOT use regex crates (`regex`) or regex patterns when implementing `check-commit-msg` in `crates/verify-baseline`.
Implement commit message validation using a deterministic lexical token scanner / token iterator in pure Rust:
- Tokenize into words, separators, and punctuation.
- Detect forbidden auto-closing verbs (`fix`, `fixes`, `fixed`, `close`, `closes`, `closed`, `resolve`, `resolves`, `resolved`) immediately preceding `#<digits>`.
- Validate neutral citations `(#<id>)` and `(refs #<id>)`.
