# Rule: SysML v2 Model-as-SSOT & Non-Drifting Elaboration Invariant

**ALWAYS enforce:** SysML v2 is the 100% Single Source of Truth (SSOT) for all system architecture, behavior, interface definitions, and safety invariants in the Digital Engineering Autonomous Pipeline (DEAP). All downstream engineering artifacts and backlog specifications must be formally declared in and synchronized with the SysML v2 Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).

## Scope and Normative Authority

**This file is the single normative home for SysML v2 Single Source of Truth (SSOT) completeness and non-drifting elaboration invariants.**

The SysML v2 model (`.pipeline/schema.sysml` and underlying AST definitions) is the authoritative, mathematically grounded system model. Downstream specifications (Epics, Features, User Stories, and Use Cases), verification plans, and code generation targets are formal projections and elaborations of this model.

## Primary Commercial Toolchain Integration Context

This project explicitly declares **MATLAB / Simulink / Stateflow / Embedded Coder** as the Primary Tier-1 Commercial Toolchain Integration Context.

- **Model-Based Design (MBD)**: High-level architectural blocks and dynamic plant/controller interactions defined in SysML v2 map directly to Simulink block diagrams and subsystem hierarchies.
- **Control Law Synthesis & State Machines**: SysML v2 statecharts, action sequences, and operational modes drive Stateflow truth tables, state transition diagrams, and discrete-event supervisors.
- **High-Integrity Code Generation**: Structural definitions, typed ports, and algorithmic actions feed Embedded Coder for DO-178C / DO-331 qualified C and SPARK Ada safety-critical embedded software synthesis.
- **Verification & Validation**: Simulink Test, Simulink Design Verifier (SLDV), and Polyspace static analysis enforce formal property checking against SysML v2 requirement definitions and STPA/FMECA invariants.

## Formal Specification Declaration Invariants

Every downstream engineering specification artifact MUST be formally rooted in and mapped to corresponding SysML v2 AST elements:

1. **Epics & Features -> Structural Definitions (`package`, `part def`, `item def`)**:
   - Every Epic must map to a top-level or architectural `package` defining subsystem boundaries.
   - Every Feature specification must map to at least one `part def` (structural component/block) or `item def` (data definition/message payload).
   - Component hierarchies, composition relationships, and data item schemas must be formally defined in SysML v2 before Feature elaboration.

2. **User Stories -> Behavioral & Interface Definitions (`action def`, `state def`, `port def`)**:
   - Every User Story must map to formal behavioral elements: discrete computational operations (`action def`), lifecycle and operational modes (`state def`), or interface boundaries (`port def`).
   - Given-When-Then BDD scenarios must execute against the actions, states, and ports declared on the parent component's SysML definition.
   - Parameter inputs (`in`), outputs (`out`), and flow directions must be explicitly typed.

3. **Use Cases -> Formal Use Case Definitions (`use case def`)**:
   - Every Use Case specification must be declared as a formal `use case def` in the SysML v2 model.
   - Each `use case def` MUST formally specify:
     - `subject`: The system or subsystem part under design (`part def`) providing the capability.
     - `actor`: Primary initiating actors and secondary participating actors (bound via typed ports/interfaces).
     - `objective`: Formal operational goal and success criteria.
     - `include` / `extend`: Formal relationships connecting modular or conditional sub-use-cases.

4. **Safety Invariants -> Formal Requirement Definitions (`requirement def`)**:
   - All safety constraints derived from STPA (System-Theoretic Process Analysis: Unsafe Control Actions, Loss Scenarios) and FMECA (Failure Mode, Effects, and Criticality Analysis) MUST be modeled as formal `requirement def` nodes.
   - Requirements must define unique identifiers, textual statements, formal constraint expressions (`assume` / `require`), and risk/hazard IDs.
   - Every `requirement def` must declare explicit `satisfy` or `verify` dependencies linking to the implementing `part def`, `action def`, or `state def`.

## Zero Model Drift & Bidirectional Parity Mandate

SysML v2 model parity is non-negotiable across all lifecycle phases:

- **Tandem Elaboration**: When downstream specifications (Epics, Features, User Stories, Use Cases) are created, refined, or modified during pipeline execution, the SysML v2 model (`.pipeline/schema.sysml`) MUST be updated in tandem.
- **100% Bidirectional Parity**: No specification element, state transition, port interface, or action signature may exist in backlog Markdown without a corresponding SysML v2 AST declaration, and no SysML v2 model element may remain unextracted/untraced in specifications.
- **Re-Generation & Verification Gate**: Any modification to functional requirements or behavioral flows must regenerate the SysML v2 AST digest (`.pipeline/schema-digest.json`) and pass parity auditor validation before commits are accepted.

## Prohibition of Heuristic Prose Parsing

- **Formal AST Priority**: Tools, linters, validators, and code generators MUST operate directly on the structured SysML v2 Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) nodes.
- **Zero Heuristic Parsing**: Inferring system structure, types, ports, or message signatures from unstructured natural language Markdown prose is strictly prohibited when formal SysML v2 AST nodes exist.
- **Deterministic Toolchain Ingestion**: Downstream synthesis tools (including MATLAB/Simulink bridges, state machine generators, and interface validators) must consume the validated AST representation to ensure mathematical determinism and prevent specification ambiguity.

## Pure Schema-Driven & Domain-Agnostic Compilation

- **Generic AST Invariant**: SysML v2 parsing, AST extraction, and verification gates in DEAP operate purely on generic AST tokens (`package`, `part def`, `item def`, `action def`, `state def`, `port def`, `requirement def`, `use case def`, and their typed relationships) without domain-specific heuristics, assumptions, or hardcoded entity names.
- **Zero Domain-Biasing**: The MBSE compiler and verification tools MUST NOT encode domain-specific rules (e.g., flight controllers, automotive sensors, medical infusion logic) into parsing or checking algorithms. All semantics are derived purely and deterministically from user-provided schema definitions in `schema/`.
- **Mathematical Determinism**: Universal token-based processing ensures absolute mathematical determinism and cross-domain portability across aerospace, automotive, defense, medical, and industrial automation engineering domains.

## Automated Closed-Loop Reverse Synchronization

To guarantee zero model drift between agile specification backlogs and the architectural model, DEAP mandates the **Automated Closed-Loop Reverse Synchronization standard**:

- **Reverse Sync Compilation Mandate**: Whenever subagents or engineers elaborate, refine, or add new structural elements, state transitions, port interfaces, action signatures, use cases, or safety constraints in markdown specifications (`docs/epics`, `docs/features`, `docs/user-stories`, `docs/use-cases`), the reverse synchronization compiler MUST be executed:
  ```bash
  python3 scripts/compile_sysml.py --reverse-sync
  ```
- **Automated AST Extraction & Elaboration**: The `--reverse-sync` engine mechanically extracts:
  1. *Structural Blocks & Items*: Ingests YAML frontmatter metadata and Mermaid class diagrams, compiling newly declared components and payload schemas into `part def` and `item def` nodes.
  2. *Behavioral Statecharts & Actions*: Ingests Mermaid state diagrams and Given-When-Then BDD scenarios, compiling state transitions, guards, events, and action signatures with typed parameters into `state def` and `action def` nodes.
  3. *Use Cases & Interaction Flows*: Ingests Use Case realization tables, actor/subject bindings, and include/extend trees, compiling them into formal `use case def` nodes.
  4. *Safety & RTA Invariants*: Ingests STPA UCA and FMECA tables, compiling safety rules into formal `requirement def`, `constraint def`, and `assert constraint` nodes.
- **Non-Destructive Semantic Merge & Digest Regeneration**: The AST merge engine merges extracted AST deltas into `.pipeline/schema.sysml` without destroying existing formal invariants, serializes the updated model via canonical `to_sysml()` emission, and regenerates the SHA-256 cryptographic digest in `.pipeline/schema-digest.json`.
- **Pre-Commit Verification Lock**: All reverse-synchronized models MUST immediately undergo verification via `verify_model_coverage.py` across all 23 parity gates before commits or pull requests are merged.

## Check 23: Factual Grounding & Numeric Provenance Gate (Attribute-Level AST Closure & SSOT Citation Contract)

Check 23 enforces absolute physical fidelity, attribute-level AST closure, and factual provenance across all downstream specifications (`docs/conops`, `docs/features`, `docs/epics`, `docs/icds`, `docs/use-cases`, `docs/user-stories`) against the SysML v2 AST and Level 0 OEM schema (`schema/` and `schema/extracted/`).

### 1. Mandatory SSOT Bill of Materials (BOM) Extraction & Parameter Grounding
- **Level 0 Ground Truth Extraction**: All physical components, quantities, actuation mechanisms, and environmental/operational boundaries declared in Level 0 OEM specification tables and Bill of Materials (BOM) in `schema/` or `schema/extracted/` form the immutable parametric foundation of the system.
- **AST Attribute Parameter Grounding**: Extracted physical parameters must be formally declared in SysML v2 as typed attributes (e.g. `attribute actuatorCount : Integer = 4;`, `attribute maxOperatingLimit : Real = 12.0;`) or part definitions.

### 2. Attribute-Level AST Closure
- **Universal Parameter Alignment**: All numeric limits, actuator and channel counts, structural configurations, electrical/datalink communication protocols, and physical dimensions referenced across downstream specifications must be formally declared in and grounded against the SysML AST and schema ground truth.
- **Rejection of Ungrounded Structural Assertions**:
  - *Structural & Component Drift*: Claiming a dual-redundant topology when the BOM or SysML AST defines 4 quad-redundant channels, or asserting 2 actuators when 4 are defined, is strictly prohibited and rejected under rule `factual-grounding-numeric-drift`.
  - *Fabricated Operational Limits & Thresholds*: Fabricating operational limits or physical metrics (e.g., asserting an ungrounded 18g/18-bar dynamic load when the schema limit is 12.0 or unsubstantiated) is strictly prohibited under rule `factual-grounding-numeric-drift`.
  - *Unverified Communication & Electrical Protocols*: Mentioning ungrounded protocol standards (e.g., STANAG 4586, STANAG 4609, MIL-STD-1553, ARINC 429, CANopen) that are not declared in SysML AST port/item definitions or Level 0 OEM documents is rejected under rule `factual-grounding-unverified-protocol`.

### 3. Temporal Safety in Sequence Diagrams (Mandatory HITL Authorization)
- **Prohibition of Autonomous Arming**: Autonomous generation of physical arming, firing, ignition, or weapon/pyrotechnic release signals is strictly forbidden.
- **Explicit Temporal Precedence**: In any Mermaid sequence diagram (`sequenceDiagram`) across `docs/`, every physical arming, firing, or motor-enable signal targeting safety-critical actuators, pyrotechnics, rocket motors, or fuzing circuits MUST be preceded temporally by an explicit Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) C2 arming command, operator consent, or pilot authorization.
- **Enforcement Rule**: Any sequence diagram attempting physical arming without prior human operator C2 consent is immediately rejected under rule `factual-grounding-temporal-safety-violation`.

### 4. SSOT Citation Contract & Machine-Resolvable Provenance
- **Traceability Citations**: Any specification claim or parametric assertion derived from OEM baseline data must carry explicit, machine-resolvable citations. Acceptable forms include:
  - HTML citation comments: `<!-- Source: schema/model.sysml -->` or `<!-- SSOT: schema/extracted/oem_bom.md -->`
  - Markdown links to schema files: `[OEM Airframe Spec](schema/.../oem_spec.md)`
  - YAML frontmatter metadata: `source_references` or `realized_ast_nodes` declaring the exact source files.
- **Contextual Non-Normative Filtering**: Non-normative sections (e.g., Glossaries, Acronym lists, MCDA Trade Studies / Alternatives Analysis evaluating rejected design candidates) and Markdown code fences/comments are exempt from positive assertion drift checks.

## M2 Metamodel Closed-Vocabulary Typing Invariant (Check 19 & Universal Parity Gates)

To ensure pure schema-driven compilation and absolute platform decoupling, the DEAP upstream specification core compiler (`UPSTREAM_SPEC_CORE_COMPILER`) enforces the **M2 Metamodel Closed-Vocabulary Typing Invariant** across all 23 parity verification gates:

### 1. Closed M2 Metamodel Allowlist (`ALLOWED_M2_METAMODEL_TYPES`)
All upstream tools, validator modules, AST parsers, and prompt payload generators operate strictly within the closed set of abstract M2 metamodel entity definitions:
- **Structural Core**: `Component`, `Class`, `Port`, `Interface`, `Statechart`, `Constraint`, `Signal`, `Event`, `AcceptanceCriterion`, `Scenario`, `TraceLink`
- **SysML v2 Definitions**: `Package`, `PackageDefinition`, `PartDefinition`, `PortDefinition`, `StateDefinition`, `ItemDefinition`, `ActionDefinition`, `RequirementDefinition`, `UseCaseDefinition`, `ConstraintDefinition`, `AttributeDefinition`, `ConnectionDefinition`, `AllocationDefinition`, `ViewDefinition`, `ViewpointDefinition`
- **Roles & Actor Boundary Types**: `ActorDefinition`, `HumanOperator`, `SystemController`, `SafetyInterlock`, `PhysicalActuator`, `Sensor`, `SystemUnderStudy`, `ExternalSystem`, `OperatorConsole`
- **Canonical M2 Tokens & Meta Prefixes**: `Actor`, `Part`, `Item`, `Action`, `State`, `Requirement`, `UseCase`, `Attribute`, `Connection`, `Allocation`, `Transition`, `Guard`, `Trigger`, `Effect`, plus any entity prefixed with `meta_` or `Meta` (e.g., `meta_component`, `MetaPart`).

### 2. Upstream M2 Compiler vs Downstream M1 Instance Boundary
- **Upstream Spec Core Compiler**: Strictly prohibited from defining, hardcoding, or expecting concrete M1 domain instance entities (e.g., specific vehicle models, airframe names, flight control PID gains, medical dosage algorithms, or automotive ECUs). Upstream logic must be 100% abstract, generic, and schema-agnostic.
- **Downstream Application Workspaces**: Concrete M1 domain models, OEM parameters, and system instances reside exclusively in downstream repositories (`DOWNSTREAM_APPLICATION_WORKSPACE`) and are parsed dynamically from `schema/*.sysml` AST nodes.

### 3. Rejection Rule: `domain-metamodel-typing-violation`
Any upstream Python script, AST visitor, validator dictionary, or static data structure that declares or returns unvalidated M1 domain instance tokens/dictionaries is rejected immediately by Check 19 (`check_domain_agnostic_ast_cleanliness` powered by `ClosedGrammarMetamodelValidator`) under the deterministic rule ID `domain-metamodel-typing-violation`.

### 4. Context Sandboxing & Downstream Path Stripping (`sandbox_upstream_dispatch_payload`)
When dispatching subagents in upstream compiler mode:
- All prompt payloads undergo deterministic context sandboxing via `sandbox_upstream_dispatch_payload()`.
- Any downstream customer workspace paths or external jail directories are automatically stripped.
- The formal M2 Metamodel Contract directive is injected into subagent instructions to guarantee isolated abstract execution without context drift.

## Why

Treating textual specifications and models as separate entities inevitably causes specification drift, where documentation diverges from the architectural model and code generation toolchains. Enforcing SysML v2 as the 100% Single Source of Truth guarantees model integrity, enables automated bidirectional validation, and provides an unbroken digital thread from high-level safety invariants to generated DO-178C / ISO 26262 C/SPARK Ada safety-critical code.
