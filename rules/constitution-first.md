# Rule: Constitution First

**ALWAYS enforce:** Before beginning any pipeline task, read the project constitution.

## Required reads

1. **Agent operating rules** (`.agents/AGENTS.md`) -- project-scoped agent rules, including the **Strict Planning Gate** that governs when file writes are permitted. Read this FIRST, before the constitution. It states the strictest authorization rule in the repository, and omitting it leads agents to act on weaker rules found elsewhere.
2. **Functional constitution** (located at the path resolved from configuration, e.g., `.pipeline/constitution.md`) -- domain rules, spec standards, agent behavior, quality gates. Read this before ANY task (specification or implementation).
3. **Implementation profile** (located under the profiles directory, e.g., `.pipeline/profiles/<platform>.md`) -- platform-specific coding standards, testing mandates, build config. Read this ONLY when implementing features, not during spec generation.

## Hard constraints

- If the functional constitution file exists in the repository, you MUST read it before starting work. Do not skip it.
- If you are implementing a feature and no implementation profile exists for the target platform, HALT and ask the human to create one.
- If a proposed change conflicts with any constitution document, HALT and escalate to the human.
- Specification workers/modules MUST NOT read implementation profiles -- they operate on functional specs only.
- You MUST read `.agents/AGENTS.md` before writing or modifying any file. Its *Strict Planning Gate* requires an approved implementation plan and overrides any rule that treats an authorization keyword alone as sufficient. See `rules/user-authorization-lock.md` § *Precedence*.
- `.pipeline` and `.agents` are hidden directories and generic glob tools may exclude them. You MUST read `.agents/AGENTS.md`, `.pipeline/constitution.md` and `.pipeline/profiles/` directly by their explicit paths. A file absent from this list and hidden from glob is effectively invisible -- that is how the strictest authorization rule came to be missed.

## Why

The constitution captures non-negotiable project constraints. Without reading it, agents may violate platform rules, skip required test types, use forbidden dependencies, or produce specs that don't conform to domain standards.
