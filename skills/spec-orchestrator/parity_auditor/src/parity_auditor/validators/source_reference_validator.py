"""Rejects Source References that lost their authoritative locator (issues #320, #322).

During drafting a subagent rewrites an upstream locator such as
``https://github.com/YangModels/yang/blob/main/ietf-geo.yang`` into a fabricated local
one under this repository. The prompt supplies the upstream URL for *retrieval*, and
nothing required preserving it in the output (#322). No gate extracted Markdown links
at all, so the rewrite published cleanly (#320).

**This gate is offline by mandate, and does not check reachability.**
``.pipeline/upstream/pipeline-tooling.md`` § *Validation Gates* requires blocking gates
to be offline and dependency-free, and forbids sending specification content to a third
party. #320's text asks for reachability checking; implementing it would put an HTTP
call on the critical path of every registration, failing whenever the far end is down or
rate-limits -- for reasons unrelated to correctness -- and would leak specification
content to whoever is asked. What is checked instead is the *structure* of the rewrite,
which is what actually catches #322 and needs no network.

Deliberately not enforced
-------------------------
* *Reachability of any URL.* See above. A network-dependent blocking gate is forbidden.
* *Repository-internal links generally.* Specifications legitimately cite
  ``.pipeline/constitution.md`` and the platform profiles by relative path, and the live
  corpus is full of them. Flagging every internal link would reject correct content
  wholesale, and the first response would be to switch the gate off.
* *Whether an upstream URL is the "right" one.* Only that an external artefact is not
  described by a self-referential locator. Judging which upstream URL is correct needs
  the source material, which this gate does not have.
