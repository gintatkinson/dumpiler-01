"""Rejects backlog specifications that claim the same title (issue #318).

Every other gate in this package looked at schema coverage, UML conformance, filenames
or Mermaid syntax. None looked at ``title``. That is the one field
``reconcile_backlog.py`` builds its issue lookup on, so a duplicate title is not a
tidiness problem: it is an ambiguous key, and the reconciler resolves it by last-writer-
wins. The observed consequences are #316 (one specification's body published over
another's) and #329 (the loser orphaned). This gate runs offline, before anything is
published, which is the cheapest place to stop that.

**Uniqueness is scoped per spec type, not globally.** Issue #303 settled the same
question for ``SyncValidator``, which keys on ``(spec_type, normalised_title)``: an
epic issue is not satisfied by a same-titled feature file, and an Epic naming a theme
alongside a Feature delivering part of it is ordinary, correct output. A global set --
as the proposed correction on #318 sketches -- would reject that pairing and the first
thing anyone would do is disable the gate. The collision that does damage is two
specifications *of the same type*, because that is the key the reconciler collides in.
The backlog directory is the spec type: one directory per type is the layout every
other validator here assumes.

**Normalisation is ``reconcile_backlog.py``'s, deliberately.** Including its guard that
keeps the original title when prefix-stripping would empty it. A gate that exists to
prevent the reconciler mis-resolving has to collide in exactly the space the reconciler
collides in; a stricter normaliser invents collisions the reconciler does not have, and
a looser one misses the ones it does.

**Resolved.** This module used to carry its own copy of that function, noting the three
divergent copies in the repository as an adjacent defect deferred to the reconciler work.
That work is done: ``normalize_spec_title`` is now the reconciler's own function, bound
by reference in ``utils/spec_titles.py``, which also records why the dependency runs in
that direction. The name is kept here because it is this module's published surface.
