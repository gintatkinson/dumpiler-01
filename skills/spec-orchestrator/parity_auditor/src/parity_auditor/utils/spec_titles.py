"""The one specification-title normaliser, shared by every gate that protects it.

`reconcile_backlog.py` addresses tracker issues by normalised title whenever a spec has
no canonical `issue_id` yet (#314/#316 demoted that path to a warning-only fallback but
did not remove it). Two validators exist to stop that key colliding -- the #318 title
uniqueness gate and `SyncValidator` -- and each carried its own copy of the normaliser.
They had drifted: `sync_validator`'s copy lacked the guard that keeps the original title
when prefix-stripping would empty it, and additionally folded `_` to a space. A gate that
collides in a different space from the consumer it protects is worse than no gate -- the
looser copy misses collisions the reconciler will make, the stricter one invents
collisions it will not, and `sync_validator`'s copy managed both at once.

**Why the reconciler is the definition site, and this module only re-exports.**

The dependency has to point somewhere, and the two ends are not symmetric:

* `reconcile_backlog.py` is a standalone script. `.pipeline/upstream/pipeline-tooling.md`
  § *Platform & Stack* says `skills/*/scripts/` SHOULD be standard-library only, and
  `AGENTS.md` § *Backlog Reconciliation Mandate* requires it to run before every merge --
  including in a downstream repository that has never installed this package. Making it
  import `parity_auditor` would make a mandated pre-merge step fail on a missing
  third-party install.
* `parity_auditor` is an installed package whose gates only ever run against a checkout
  of the repository they audit, and whose own tests already reach the scripts directory
  by path. It can carry the locator; the script cannot carry the dependency.

It is also the correct direction on the merits. The reconciler is the *consumer* of the
key: its normalisation defines the collision space, and the gates exist to describe that
space exactly. If the two disagree, the reconciler is right by definition.

The re-export is by reference, not by copy, so the identity is checked by
`tests/test_normalize_title_unified_issue318.py` and cannot drift again.

The locator raises rather than substituting a local implementation. A fallback copy is
the defect this module exists to remove: a gate silently normalising differently from
the reconciler is precisely the failure, and it is much better caught at import.
