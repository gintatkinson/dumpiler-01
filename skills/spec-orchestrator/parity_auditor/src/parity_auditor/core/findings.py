"""Structured validator findings (issue #301).

Validators historically returned ``List[str]`` of English sentences. That is fine for a
human reading one workspace, but it defeats the purpose of aggregating symptoms across
several downstream projects: deciding that two messages describe *the same kind* of
problem requires parsing prose, which breaks the moment a message is reworded.

``Finding`` **subclasses ``str``**. That is deliberate and load-bearing. A ``Finding``
*is* its message, so every existing consumer keeps working unchanged -- ``" ".join(errors)``,
``"text" in error``, equality, f-string interpolation, sorting. Roughly 172 tests assert on
message content in those forms; without this the migration would require rewriting all of
them, and a rewrite of that size is where regressions come from.

What it adds is ``rule_id``, a stable identifier the aggregator groups on, and
``signature()``, which is deliberately **independent of the downstream project** so the
same defect in two differently-named repositories collapses to one row.
