## 9. Multi-Threaded Operational Scenarios & System Timelines

In accordance with ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148:2018 §6.4.2, OMG Unified Architecture Framework (UAF) v2.0 Operational Processes (Op-Pr), and MIL-STD-882E §4.3, this section specifies the multi-threaded operational scenarios, dynamic timelines, and deterministic decision gates governing the system lifecycle. All scenarios maintain 100% traceability to allocated operational activities (`OA-01`..`OA-08`), operational information exchanges (`OpTx-01`..`OpTx-08`), emergency containment triggers (`EMG-01`..`EMG-07`), and {{INTERLOCK_POLICY_NAME:Rules of Engagement (ROE)}} (`{{INTERLOCK_01_TAG:ROE-01}}`..`{{INTERLOCK_06_TAG:ROE-06}}`).

### 9.1 Scenario SCN-01: Nominal Lifecycle Thread
Scenario `SCN-01` describes an end-to-end nominal operational mission lifecycle from pre-operation staging through autonomous state trajectory execution, on-station mission processing, precision recovery, and controlled shutdown.
