## 4. User Classes, Stakeholder Taxonomy & Operational Lifecycle Modes

### 4.1 Stakeholder Roster
The operational lifecycle involves multiple organizational and external stakeholders who interact directly or indirectly with the autonomous system:
- **System Governance & Safety Authorities:** Regulatory and certification bodies responsible for issuing operational authorizations, validating safety cases, and monitoring compliance.
- **Operational Safety Authority & Supervisors:** Operational authorities governing corridor allocations, approving dynamic boundary activations, and coordinating emergency deconfliction.
- **System Owner & Operations Management:** Organizational or enterprise entities directing mission requirements, operating policies, and resource allocation.
- **Support & Logistics Organization:** Maintenance facilities, supply chain managers, and calibration laboratories.

### 4.2 User Class Taxonomy
In accordance with ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148:2018 §5.2.4 and the specification data contract, the operational user classes are defined as follows:

| User Class ID | Title | Player or Operator | Interfacing Stakeholder | Characteristics & Responsibilities | Training & Qualification | Constraint Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **UCL-01** | System Operator (SO) | Direct Operator | Operational Safety Authority / Operations Lead | Holds primary operational responsibility for system supervision, trajectory oversight, boundary deconfliction, and manual failsafe override initiation. | Certified System Operator with Type Qualification and Supervisory Control Certification | ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148:2018 §5.2.4 |

3. **Maintenance Technician (MT):** Formal electro-mechanical certification, electronic diagnostic inspection qualification, and authorized digital maintenance logbook endorsement.
4. **Mission Supervisor (MS):** Advanced certification in autonomous systems operations, mission risk management, and formal command authorization protocols.
5. **Safety Monitor (SM):** Certified perimeter safety observer qualification and emergency communication protocols training.

### 4.4 Workload Constraints & Human Factors Considerations
In accordance with ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148:2018 §5.2.4, MIL-STD-882E §4.3, and MIL-STD-1472H, human supervisory operators must maintain continuous situational awareness without being subjected to cognitive saturation or excessive task loading during nominal, degraded, or emergency operational phases (Fixes #120, #119).

The system adopts the NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX) 6-dimensional workload assessment model to quantify operator cognitive workload across six validated dimensions: Mental Demand ($D_1$), Physical Demand ($D_2$), Temporal Demand ($D_3$), Performance ($D_4$), Effort ($D_5$), and Frustration ($D_6$). The overall weighted composite workload score $\text{TLX}_{\mathrm{composite}}$ is mathematically defined as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{TLX}_{\mathrm{composite}} &= \sum_{i=1}^{6} w_i \cdot S_i \\
\sum_{i=1}^{6} w_i &= 1.0
\end{aligned}
$$

- Parameter Definitions & Engineering Units:
- TLX_composite: Overall weighted composite cognitive workload score on a [0, 100] scale.
- w_i: Normalized weighting coefficient for dimension i, where the sum of all w_i equals 1.0.
- S_i: Raw subjective workload rating score for dimension i on a scale of [0, 100].
- TLX_nominal_max: Maximum allowable composite workload under nominal operations (TLX_nominal_max <= 35).
- TLX_contingency_max: Maximum allowable composite workload under degraded or contingency operations (TLX_contingency_max <= 55).

The Quantitative 6-Dimensional NASA-TLX Cognitive Workload Matrix Table is defined below:

| Dimension ID | Dimension Name | Description & Evaluation Focus | Weight (w_i) | Nominal Threshold | Contingency Threshold | Scale Range |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **TLX-01** | Mental Demand | Cognitive processing, decision making, calculating, searching, and remembering required during operational supervision | {{TLX_WEIGHT_MD:0.25}} | Score <= 35 | Score <= 55 | 0 - 100 |
| **TLX-02** | Physical Demand | Physical actions required at the console, including control input manipulation, interface navigation, and peripheral device operation | {{TLX_WEIGHT_PD:0.10}} | Score <= 35 | Score <= 55 | 0 - 100 |
| **TLX-03** | Temporal Demand | Time pressure experienced due to task pacing, telemetry update rates, and time-critical operational decision windows | {{TLX_WEIGHT_TD:0.20}} | Score <= 35 | Score <= 55 | 0 - 100 |
| **TLX-04** | Performance | Perceived operator success in achieving mission objectives, maintaining corridor compliance, and fulfilling task standards | {{TLX_WEIGHT_OP:0.15}} | Score <= 35 | Score <= 55 | 0 - 100 |
| **TLX-05** | Effort | Total mental and physical exertion required to maintain the required level of operational performance | {{TLX_WEIGHT_EF:0.15}} | Score <= 35 | Score <= 55 | 0 - 100 |
| **TLX-06** | Frustration | Level of insecurity, discouragement, irritation, stress, or annoyance experienced during system interaction | {{TLX_WEIGHT_FR:0.15}} | Score <= 35 | Score <= 55 | 0 - 100 |
| **Composite** | Overall Weighted TLX | Weighted aggregate cognitive workload index across all operational tasks and supervisory duties | 1.00 | Score <= 35 | Score <= 55 | 0 - 100 |

- **Decoupled Workstation Architecture:** Primary system safety oversight (`UCL-01`) and sensor payload analysis (`UCL-02`) are decoupled across distinct physical workstations to prevent operational task interference and excessive cognitive loading.
- **Dynamic Task Shedding:** Under high workload conditions ($S_i > 55$ or $\text{TLX}_{\mathrm{composite}} > 35$), non-critical background administrative tasks are automatically deferred by the supervisory interface.

### 4.4.1 Operational Shift Rotation Protocol
To mitigate operator fatigue, sustain continuous situational vigilance, and prevent human performance degradation during extended operations, the system enforces a strict operational shift rotation protocol (Fixes #120, #119):

$$
\begin{aligned}
t_{\mathrm{shift}} &\le t_{\text{shift\_max}} \\
t_{\mathrm{rest}} &\ge t_{\text{rest\_min}} \\
t_{\mathrm{daily}} &\le t_{\text{daily\_max}}
\end{aligned}
$$

- Parameter Definitions & Engineering Units:
- t_shift: Continuous supervisory console duty duration per shift (hr).
- t_shift_max: Maximum permissible continuous console duty time (t_shift <= 4.0 hr).
- t_rest: Mandatory rest break duration between consecutive console shifts (min).
- t_rest_min: Minimum mandatory rest break interval (t_rest >= 30.0 min).
- t_daily: Cumulative console operational duty duration within a rolling 24-hour cycle (hr).
- t_daily_max: Maximum cumulative daily console duty limit (t_daily_max <= 8.0 hr).

| Parameter Name | Symbol | Standard Bound | Units | Operational Rule / Constraint |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Continuous Console Duty | t_shift | <= {{MAX_SHIFT_HOURS:4.0}} | hr | Maximum uninterrupted supervisory console session per operator (t_shift <= 4.0 hr) |
| Minimum Rest Interval | t_rest | >= {{MIN_REST_MINUTES:30.0}} | min | Mandatory non-operational rest interval between active shifts (t_rest >= 30.0 min) |
| Cumulative Daily Limit | t_daily_max | <= {{MAX_DAILY_HOURS:8.0}} | hr | Maximum cumulative console duty within any rolling 24-hour cycle (t_daily_max <= 8.0 hr) |
| Shift Handover Overlap | t_overlap | >= {{MIN_OVERLAP_MINUTES:15.0}} | min | Mandatory cross-briefing and state synchronization window prior to C2 transfer |

The shift rotation protocol incorporates the following mandatory operational rules:
1. **Continuous Console Duty Limit ($t_{\mathrm{shift}} \le 4.0\text{ hr}$):** No operator shall remain on active supervisory console duty for longer than 4.0 continuous hours without a mandatory rest break.
2. **Minimum Rest Interval ($t_{\mathrm{rest}} \ge 30.0\text{ min}$):** Between consecutive supervisory console shifts, operators must take a minimum non-operational rest interval of at least 30.0 minutes.
3. **Cumulative Daily Duty Cap ($t_{\text{daily\_max}} \le 8.0\text{ hr}$):** Total active supervisory console time for an individual operator within any rolling 24-hour window shall not exceed 8.0 hours.
4. **Mandatory Shift Handover Overlap ($t_{\mathrm{overlap}} \ge 15.0\text{ min}$):** Incoming and outgoing operators must participate in a structured handover briefing covering current system state, trajectory corridors, environmental conditions, and resource reserves before transferring control authority.
5. **Fatigue-Triggered Reassignment:** If an operator exhibits elevated NASA-TLX scores exceeding nominal limits (Score > 35) or experiences continuous high-workload degraded mode management, the Mission Supervisor is empowered to mandate an immediate relief rotation.

### 4.5 Operational Authority Delegation & Supervisory Handover Protocol
Operational supervisory authority transfer between certified User Classes (e.g. System Operator UCL-01 to incoming System Operator UCL-01, or delegation to Mission Supervisor UCL-03) follows a structured operational protocol bounded by operational response thresholds ($t_{\mathrm{handoff}} \le \tau_{\text{handoff\_max}}$):

1. **Handover Briefing & Status Review:** The outgoing operator reviews current system state vector, active trajectory or operating corridors, environmental stress metrics, and remaining energy/resource reserves with the incoming operator.
2. **State Alignment & Parameter Verification:** The incoming operator verifies that telemetry parameters, boundary containment margins, and active mission goals match operational constraints.
3. **Formal Relinquishment & Assumption:** The outgoing operator formally relinquishes supervisory control; the incoming operator confirms positive assumption of command and control responsibility.
4. **Operational Log & Audit Archival:** The delegation transaction is timestamped and recorded in the tamper-evident mission log.

Where architectural subsystem control handoffs or automated cryptographic handshakes are declared in the system model, they are derived dynamically from the SysML architecture:

### 4.6 Operational Lifecycle Stages ($\Phi_{\mathrm{lifecycle}}$)
The system operates across six mutually exclusive, deterministic lifecycle stages:
- **Phase_Startup:** Power-on Built-In-Test (PBIT), sensor alignment, state estimator initialization, cryptographic key verification, and pre-operation interlock validation.
- **Phase_NominalExecution:** Autonomous mission start, transit along designated state corridors, operational state monitoring, payload processing, and real-time telemetry streaming.
- **Phase_DegradedMode:** Non-critical sensor failover, reversion to dead reckoning upon reference signal loss, PACE datalink fallback switch, and degraded parameter limits.
- **Phase_ContingencyFailsafe:** Autonomous execution of {{LIFECYCLE_FAILSAFE_SEQUENCE}}, transition to secondary emergency recovery location, or controlled state containment.
- **Phase_SecureShutdown:** Autonomous precision arrival, controlled deceleration to stop, actuator lock, cryptographic memory zeroization, and diagnostic log archival.
- **Phase_MaintenanceMode:** Diagnostic telemetry offload, actuator calibration, firmware updating, and structural/hardware inspection.
