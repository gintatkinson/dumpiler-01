# Tactical Mission Intent & Execution Plan

## 1. Commander's Intent & Operational Objectives

- **Operational Purpose:** {{OPERATIONAL_PURPOSE}}
- **Key Tasks:**
  - Execute pre-operation Built-In-Test (BIT) self-diagnostics, calibration, and cryptographic link binding within $t_{\mathrm{PBIT}} \le \tau_{\text{PBIT\_max}}$ of power activation.
  - Conduct autonomous transit along designated multi-dimensional state corridors while maintaining strict state boundary containment within $x_{\text{operating\_max}}$.
  - Perform real-time multi-modal sensor processing and persistent state tracking over designated operational zones.
  - Maintain continuous boundary deconfliction and separation minima from non-cooperative external entities.
  - Stream encrypted system telemetry across the primary C2 link with automatic failover across alternate, contingency, and emergency PACE tiers.
  - Enforce dual-consent cryptographic authorization and positive condition verification ($C_{\mathrm{condition}} \ge C_{\mathrm{threshold}}$) prior to executing high-consequence operational tasks.
  - {{LIFECYCLE_BINGO_SAFETY_ACTION}}
  - {{LIFECYCLE_POST_OP_STATE}}
- **End State:** {{LIFECYCLE_END_STATE}}
