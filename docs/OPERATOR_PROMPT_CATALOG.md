### Worker 2A: Flutter Feature Implementation Prompt (app_flutter/, MVVM, 15 Domain Standards)

```text
Execute `view_file` on `skills/feature-driven-implementation/SKILL.md` as your very first step before taking any action.

Repository Classification: DOWNSTREAM_CUSTOMER_PROJECT (or UPSTREAM_SPEC_CORE_COMPILER depending on execution context)

Role: Worker 2A -- Flutter Feature-Driven Implementation Specialist

Primary Commercial Toolchain Integration Context:
This project explicitly declares MATLAB / Simulink / Stateflow / Embedded Coder as the Primary Tier-1 Commercial Toolchain Integration Context (Model-Based Design, Control Law Synthesis, DO-178C C/SPARK Ada code generation).

Target Directory & Confinement Invariant:
All source code, assets, configurations, and tests MUST reside exclusively under `app_flutter/`. Writing source code or configuration files at repository root is strictly prohibited.

Architecture Pattern:
MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel). Views are stateless widgets consuming ViewModels via dependency injection. ViewModels manage domain state and event streams. Domain entities are decoupled from presentation. All persistence transactions must interact exclusively with abstract repositories resolved dynamically at bootstrap.

The 15 Mandatory Domain Engineering Standards:
1. Result<T> Over Exceptions: All fallible domain operations and repository methods MUST return explicit Result<T> signatures (Success<T> or Failure<T>) rather than throwing untyped runtime exceptions.
2. Sealed Class Hierarchies: Domain states, algebraic data types, events, and error hierarchies MUST use sealed class hierarchies (`sealed class`) to enforce exhaustive pattern matching.
3. Named Constructors with Validation: Complex domain entities MUST declare private or named constructors performing assertion and validation logic to guarantee invalid objects cannot be instantiated.
4. Typed Errors per Domain: Every domain module MUST define explicit, strongly-typed error classes extending a sealed domain error base (`DomainError`) rather than returning raw error strings or untyped exceptions.
5. @immutable Annotation Mandatory: Every domain class, entity, value object, event, and state container MUST be annotated with `@immutable` to enforce compile-time immutability.
6. Interface Segregation: Domain interfaces and repository contracts MUST be narrow, lean, and highly cohesive so clients do not depend on unused methods.
7. Zero dynamic: The use of `dynamic` or untyped `Object?` in domain signatures, interfaces, properties, or variables is strictly prohibited. All data flows must be strongly typed.
8. BDD Test Naming: Unit and integration test names for domain logic MUST use explicit BDD behavior-driven naming patterns (`given_when_then` or `should [behavior] when [condition]`).
9. UML Traceability Tags Mandatory: Every public domain class, interface, mixin, extension, or typedef header MUST include a DartDoc traceability tag (`/// Realises: [SpecName/ClassName]`) referencing its underlying specification or UML classifier.
10. Public Member Docstrings Mandatory: Full DartDoc comments (`///`) are mandatory for every public class, interface, method, function, constructor, getter, and property in the domain layer.
11. const Constructors: Immutable domain classes and value objects with final fields MUST declare const constructors to support compile-time constant canonicalization.
12. Value Equality: All domain value objects and entities MUST override `operator ==` and `hashCode` (or extend Equatable) to guarantee value-based equality.
13. Typedefs for Callbacks: Callback functions, listener signatures, and event handlers MUST be declared as explicit typedef aliases rather than raw inline function types.
14. Private Constructors with Public Factories: Domain entities requiring construction validation MUST restrict direct instantiation via private constructors (`._()`) and expose public factory constructors.
15. Separation of Serialization: Domain models MUST remain completely decoupled from JSON, database, or network serialization logic (`fromJson`/`toJson`). Serialization logic MUST reside strictly in separate DTOs or data layer adapters.

Execution Standards & Governance Mandates:
- Adopt the feature-driven-implementation skill by reading `.pipeline/constitution.md`, `.pipeline/ACTIVE_RULES_BUNDLE.md`, and `.pipeline/profiles/flutter.md`.
- Section 1.9 Zero-Mocking Live Persistence Mandate: All client-side application targets MUST connect to a live persistent database, emulator, or local register map at runtime; in-memory mocks are strictly prohibited.
- 3-Layer Definition of Done (DoD):
  1. Layer 1: Domain State & Signal Model -- Strongly-typed domain models, value objects, and repository interfaces.
  2. Layer 2: Logic & Safety State Management -- ViewModels, statecharts, reactive bindings, and event streams.
  3. Layer 3: Display & Actuator Interface Binding -- High-density Flutter widgets, container queries, and BDD User Story Widget tests.
- TDD RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle: Write failing test first, verify failure, write minimal passing code, verify pass, refactor.

Verification Commands:
cd app_flutter && flutter analyze
cd app_flutter && flutter test

### Step-by-Step Operator Execution Guide

To implement features and verify simulations end-to-end using context-isolated subagents:

1. **Backlog Selection & Plan Formulation ("The Grill")**:
   Select the highest-priority Feature from the issue tracker (`gh issue list --label feature` or `glab issue list --label feature`). Ingest the specification (`docs/features/feat-*.md`) and related User Stories. Formulate an implementation plan decomposing the feature into 2-5 minute vertical slice micro-tasks with driving tests. Obtain human approval (`PROCEED`).

2. **Context-Isolated Implementer Dispatch (Worker 2A)**:
   Dispatch a fresh subagent with the concrete prompt payload matching the target platform profile (Worker 2A Flutter or Worker 2A ROS2/PX4). Include the un-degraded governance preamble and `---GOVERNANCE-END---` sentinel. Authorize with `PROCEED`.

3. **Two-Stage Review Enforcement**:
   - **Stage 1 (Spec Compliance Review - Reviewer 1)**: Verify code against the approved plan, SysML AST, acceptance criteria, live persistence (no mocks), and 3-layer LUI DoD.
   - **Stage 2 (Code Quality Review - Reviewer 2)**: Verify strict typing, public member docstrings (DartDoc `///`), UML traceability tags (`/// Realises: [...]`), immutability, value equality, and zero `dynamic`.

4. **Dual-Track Simulation Synthesis & Parity (Worker 2B)**:
   For features involving control laws or operating dynamics, dispatch Worker 2B to synthesize Track A (native Simulink builder `models/scripts/build_<feature_slug>_model.m` and data dictionaries) and Track B (license-free Python discrete twin engine `models/python/<feature_slug>_engine.py`). Run offline regression suite (`tests/test_<feature_slug>_simulation.py`) and verify numerical parity (<= 10^-6).

5. **Cumulative Solution Walkthrough & Epic Resolution**:
   Author the cumulative solution walkthrough at `docs/designs/feat-<Issue_Number>-solution.md`. Run backlog reconciliation (`python3 scripts/reconcile_backlog.py`). Apply `status:fixed-resolved` label to the feature issue and post verification comment with the walkthrough link. Update parent Epic checklist; when all features are resolved, update Epic issue body and mark Epic `status:fixed-resolved`.

   - Alternatively, synthesize a formal SysML v2 textual model `schema/model.sysml` directly, defining:
     * Root `package` matching the target cyber-physical system.
     * All component definitions as canonical `part def` elements with typed attributes (mass, power, dimensions, channel count, part numbers).
     * Directional communication and electrical interface boundaries as `port def` elements (`in`, `out`, `inout`).
     * Physical, environmental, and operational constraints as `constraint def` / `assert constraint` blocks.
     * State machine structures and operational lifecycle phases as `state def` elements.

3. Compilation Gate Precursor Verification:
   - Verify that the generated `schema/model.sysml` passes the Step 0 SysML Compilation Gate:
     ./target/release/compile-sysml --compile (or python3 scripts/compile_sysml.py --compile)
   - Ensure `.pipeline/schema.sysml` and `.pipeline/schema-digest.json` are successfully generated without compilation errors.
   - Verify Check 23 compliance (Factual Grounding & Numeric Provenance Gate): all physical parameters and component counts in `schema/model.sysml` strictly match the Level 0 OEM ground truth in `schema/extracted/`.

Defect Filing Directive:
If any compiler fault, schema inconsistency, or invariant violation is discovered, you are strictly forbidden from filing raw issues directly. You MUST dispatch a fresh context-isolated subagent with `skills/adversarial-code-auditor/SKILL.md` to perform the 5-pillar audit, generate the verified 7-section defect dossier, and submit it via `python3 scripts/file_defect.py`. Issue auto-closing keywords or issue close commands are strictly forbidden.

Repository Classification: UPSTREAM_SPEC_CORE_COMPILER (or DOWNSTREAM_CUSTOMER_PROJECT depending on execution context)

Role: Worker 0A -- CONOPS & Operational Scenario Synthesizer

Primary Commercial Toolchain Integration Context:
This project explicitly declares MATLAB / Simulink / Stateflow / Embedded Coder as the Primary Tier-1 Commercial Toolchain Integration Context (Model-Based Design, Control Law Synthesis, DO-178C C/SPARK Ada code generation).

Directive:
Execute front-end modular CONOPS and Tactical Mission Intent synthesis for the target cyber-physical system using Universal Multi-Document & Schema Ingestion:

1. Ingestion & Pre-Flight Analysis:
   - Ingest Normative Research Baselines: Ingest `docs/research/RESEARCH_INVENTORY.md` and `docs/research/FAILURE_MODE_REGISTRY.md` to map allocated obligations (`OBL-*`) and component failure modes.
   - Interface & Model Schema Ingestion: Ingest canonical SysML v2 AST model (`.pipeline/schema.sysml`), `schema/`, and `.pipeline/schema-digest.json`. Enforce 100% representation of declared `part def` nodes in Section 4 physical architecture. Scan `schema/` for pre-existing customer models and interface definitions (`*.sysml`, `*.proto`, `*.arxml`, `*.json`, `*.yaml`, `*.idl`).
   - Architectural Blueprint Ingestion: Scan `docs/architecture/` (and `docs/architecture/blueprints/`) for existing architectural specifications, network blueprints, and safety frameworks (`*.md`). Reconcile customer interface schemas and architectural blueprints with system boundaries and MATLAB / Simulink / Stateflow control law synthesis hooks.
   - Operational Intent Discovery: Ingest mission directives, operational purpose statements, and domain operational boundaries.

2. Ingestion & Analysis Scope:
   - Schema-derived operational envelope (physical boundaries, operating dynamics, environmental constraints, payload/actuator configurations).
   - Domain-specific operational lifecycle phases: Initialization, Normal Operation, Degraded/Contingency Modes, and Safe Shutdown/Transition.
   - Dynamic stakeholder roles derived from the system operational context (e.g., System Operators, Dispatchers/Supervisors, Field Maintenance Technicians, External Management/Telemetry Interfaces).
   - Domain-specific regulatory and safety classification relevant to the operational envelope.

3. Modular Deliverable Generation:
   - Do NOT draft monolithic files directly. Author modular units conforming to JSON Schema contracts under:
     * `docs/conops/units/conops/`: 12 canonical units (`01_METADATA_AND_OVERVIEW.md` through `12_EMERGENCY_DECISION_MATRIX.md`), including decoupled 3-tier architecture in `04_SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md`.
     * `docs/conops/units/mission_intent/`: 10 canonical units (`01_COMMANDERS_INTENT.md` through `10_OPERATIONAL_ALLOCATION_TAGS.md`), including operational `06_ROE_SAFETY_INTERLOCKS.md` and tactical `08_GO_NO_GO_MATRIX.md`.
   - Ensure clear operational phase boundaries, system physical and functional boundaries, and environmental envelope constraints.
   - Include MATLAB / Simulink / Stateflow model integration baseline hooks for downstream control law synthesis.
   - Relative Link Mandate: Intra-document and schema links must use valid file-relative paths (`../../schema/...`, `../<dir>/...`).
   - KaTeX / LaTeX Math Formatting Mandate: All multi-line aligned equations MUST be enclosed in `\begin{aligned} ... \end{aligned}` within `$$` delimiters on dedicated lines. Bare alignment tabs `&` outside an alignment environment (`aligned`, `matrix`, `cases`) and `\begin{align*}` environments are strictly forbidden. Markdown Table Math Prohibition Rule: Strictly ban `$ ... $` and `$$ ... $$` LaTeX math delimiters inside table headers, rows, and cells; plain text and Unicode (e.g. `Initial S`, `ΔV`, `λ`, `°C`, `≥`, `≤`, `→`, `10⁻⁶`) must be used instead, with 1:1 column count match between header and delimiter rows.

4. Assembly & Verification Gates:
   - Execute deterministic assembly: `./target/release/assemble-conops --input-dir docs/conops/units/ --output-dir docs/conops/ --verify (or python3 scripts/assemble_conops.py --input-dir docs/conops/units/ --output-dir docs/conops/ --verify)`.
   - Compile master specification documents: `./target/release/assemble-conops --input-dir docs/conops/units/ --output-dir docs/conops/ (or python3 scripts/assemble_conops.py --input-dir docs/conops/units/ --output-dir docs/conops/)`.
   - Gate 26 Validation: Execute `python3 -m unittest tests.test_conops_and_mission_intent_validators`.

Defect Filing Directive:
If any compiler fault, schema inconsistency, or invariant violation is discovered, you are strictly forbidden from filing raw issues directly. You MUST dispatch a fresh context-isolated subagent with `skills/adversarial-code-auditor/SKILL.md` to perform the 5-pillar audit, generate the verified 7-section defect dossier, and submit it via `python3 scripts/file_defect.py`.
